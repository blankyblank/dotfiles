# Another repo of config files!

ITS CRAAAZZZY


I need to remember to actually use this. and also make sure to keep up with the changes. I don't think i'm going to stick with stow for a few reasons. But idk I'll have to have a better way. maybe making my .config entirely a git repo. with a .gitignore for certain things. but then I'll still have to worry about my .bashrc and other file in my home dir.
